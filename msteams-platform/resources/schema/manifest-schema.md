# Reference: Manifest schema for Microsoft Teams

The Teams manifest describes how the app integrates into the Microsoft Teams product. Your manifest must conform to the schema hosted at [`https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.11/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json`]( https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.11/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json). Previous versions 1.0, 1.1,..., and 1.11 are also supported (using "v1.x" in the URL).
For more information on the changes made in each version, see [manifest change log](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-app-schema/releases).

The following schema sample shows all extensibility options:

The schema defines the following properties:

## $schema

Optional, but recommended—string

The https:// URL referencing the JSON Schema for the manifest.

## manifestVersion

**Required**—string

The version of manifest schema this manifest is using. It must be 1.10.

## version

**Required**—string

The version of a specific app. When you update something in your manifest, the version must be incremented too. This way, when the new manifest is installed, it overwrites the existing one and the user receives the new functionality. When this app was submitted to the store, the new manifest must be resubmitted and revalidated. The app users receive the new updated manifest automatically within few hours after the manifest is approved.

If the app requests for permissions change, the users are prompted to upgrade and reconsent to the app.

This version string must follow the [semver](http://semver.org/) standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

## id

**Required**—Microsoft app ID

The ID is a unique Microsoft-generated identifier for the app. You have an ID if your bot is registered through the Microsoft Bot Framework. You have an ID if your tab's web app already signs in with Microsoft. You must enter the ID here. Otherwise, you must generate a new ID at the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations). Use the same ID if you add a bot.

> [!NOTE]

## permissions

**Optional**—array of strings

An array of `string`, which specifies which permissions the app requests, which let end users know how the extension does. The following options are non-exclusive:

* `identity` &emsp; Requires user identity information.
* `messageTeamMembers` &emsp; Requires permission to send direct messages to team members.

Changing these permissions during app update, causes your users to repeat the consent process after they run the updated app. For more information, see [Updating your app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/post-publish/overview.md).

## devicePermissions

**Optional**—array of strings

Provides the native features on a user's device that your app requests access to. Options are:

* `geolocation`
* `media`
* `notifications`
* `midi`
* `openExternal`

## validDomains

**Optional**, except **Required** where noted.

A list of valid domains for websites the app expects to load within the Teams client. Domain listings can include wildcards, for example, `*.example.com`. The valid domain matches exactly one segment of the domain; if you need to match `a.b.example.com` then use `*.*.example.com`. If your tab configuration or content UI navigates to any other domain other than tab configuration, that domain must be specified here.

Do **not** include the domains of identity providers you want to support in your app. For example, to authenticate using a Google ID, it is required to redirect to accounts.google.com, however, you must not include accounts.google.com in `validDomains[]`.

Teams apps that require their own SharePoint URLs to function well, includes "{teamsitedomain}" in their valid domain list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not add domains that are outside your control, either directly or through wildcards. For example, `yourapp.onmicrosoft.com` is valid, however, `*.onmicrosoft.com` is not valid.

The object is an array with all elements of the type `string`.

## webApplicationInfo

**Optional**—object

|`resource`|string|2048 characters|✔|Resource URL of app for acquiring auth token for SSO. </br> **NOTE:** If you are not using SSO, ensure that you enter a dummy string value in this field to your app manifest, for example, https://notapplicable to avoid an error response. |
