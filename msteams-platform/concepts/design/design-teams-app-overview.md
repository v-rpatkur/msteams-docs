# Designing your Microsoft Teams app

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/design-guidelines-overview.png" alt-text="Conceptual image introducing the Microsoft Teams design guidelines.":::

Whether you're a designer, product manager, developer, or maker using low-code tools, these guidelines can help you quickly make the right design decisions for your Microsoft Teams app.

## Creating a cohesive experience

Designing a Teams app is like designing a conventional web app—but also a little different. An effective design highlights your app's unique attributes while fitting naturally with Teams features and contexts.

These guidelines and resources can help you strike that balance. You'll know what to do and what to avoid when designing your Teams app (such as multi-level navigation in a tab).

## Teams app design principles

Teams apps help people achieve more together. Use these principles to guide your design.

### Collaborative

Teams app promotes collaboration through coordinated and shared activity among users.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

### Trustworthy

The app is secure and compliant. Users can easily find information about privacy.

   :::column span="":::

### Globally inclusive

People of all backgrounds, skillsets, and disciplines can use the app. It’s culturally, racially, and socially aware.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

### Light

The app focuses on core scenarios that blend with Teams workflows.

### Native or distinct

The app uses native Teams design components or your own. There’s no blend of color schemes, controls, and so on.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

### Useful

The app is based on a scenario people need to do in Teams.

### Easy to use

The UI is easy to understand, pleasant in look and tone, and makes people more productive.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

### Responsive

The app is device- and screen-agnostic.

### Accessible

The app meets Teams accessibility requirements in terms of color contrast, navigation alternatives, and more.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

### Well described

Text, icons, and images make it clear what the app is for and how to use it.

## Teams design system

Learn the [fundamentals of Teams app design](design-teams-app-fundamentals.md), including layout, color schemes, and more.

## App capabilities

Understand how people add, use, and manage Teams apps to make the most of each capability in your design.

* [Personal apps](../../concepts/design/personal-apps.md)
* [Tabs](../../tabs/design/tabs.md)
* [Messaging extensions](../../messaging-extensions/design/messaging-extension-design.md)
* [Bots](../../bots/design/bots.md)
* [Meeting extensions](../../apps-in-teams-meetings/design/designing-apps-in-meetings.md)

## UI templates

Quickly create complex, high-fidelity designs with [templates for common Teams use cases and workflows](design-teams-app-ui-templates.md).

## Basic UI components

Based on Fluent UI, these are the [core elements](design-teams-app-basic-ui-components.md) you can use to create Teams experiences from scratch.

## Tools and samples

The following tools can help designers and developers get started:

### Microsoft Teams UI Kit

Design a Teams app with UI components, templates, and examples that you can drag, drop, and modify as needed. The UI kit also includes comprehensive information about how apps should look and behave in different Teams scenarios.

> [Get the UI kit (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/community/file/916836509871353159)

### Microsoft Teams UI Library

View and test individual Teams UI templates and related components in your browser.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Try the UI library (playground)](https://dev-int.teams.microsoft.com/storybook/main/index.html)

Import these templates and related components directly into your Teams app project.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Get the UI library (GitHub)](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-ui-component-library)

### Sample app

You can upload a sample app to see how apps should look and behave in the Teams client.
